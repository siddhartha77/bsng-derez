# BSNG DeRez

Drop an application on to the icon to create a Rez file and a header file, then import those files into your CodeWarrior project for your BSNG plugin. The Rez file contains a 'cicn' of the application and the header file contains the application name and version number.

Portions of code were based on DropShell 2.0 and the original BSNG Product DeRez.
