# BSNG DeRez
Drop an application on to the icon to create a Rez file and a header file, then import those files into your CodeWarrior project for your <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/bucks-serial-number-generator-bsng">BSNG</a> plugin. The Rez file contains a 'cicn' of the application and the header file contains the application name and version number.

Portions of code were based on DropShell 2.0 and the original BSNG Product DeRez.

Greets to Buck.
